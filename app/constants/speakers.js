    talkTitle: 'Compiling Ember',
    talkAbstract: 'Compilers have a reputation for being esoteric and intimidating. But they don\'t need to be! A compiler is just a program that writes programs. This talk will be a practical tour through the Embroider build system that also teaches compiler concepts along the way. With the power of multi-pass compilation, Embroider can take a long-lived, conventional Ember app and give it lazy loading, code splitting, and tree shaking. All without modifying the app\'s own code.',

    talkAbstract: 'The humble <div> is a powerful and flexible element. Throw enough CSS and JavaScript on it, and a can be anything. But should it be? “Semantic HTML” is a method of using elements that best match what your content means and does. But how do you write better markup if you don’t know your options? Join the learning journey to fill your semantic HTML toolkit with the coolest elements you never knew existed. Learn specific elements to use in different scenarios and how to wield the full power of the HTML spec. You’ll write less code while making your pages more accessible and mobile-friendly!',

    talkAbstract: 'We naturally invent stories to explain phenomena we can\'t understand. If your app leaves changes "vague," users will make up explanations about how it works. Some developers see animation as a fancy gimmick to slap on at the end of a project. Others want to use it in a helpful way but aren\'t sure how. Both will learn that animation is a meaningful tool and how to use it effectively to reduce user error. In this talk, we\'ll avoid getting in the weeds with addons, JS libraries, or CSS frameworks. Instead we\'ll learn the ways that animation can aid your users and see practical UI examples.',

This talk will explore the different types of workers, including service workers and shared workers, and how to make the most of them in your Ember applications. We\'ll discuss the capabilities available to workers and explore different use cases, including progressive web apps.',

    talkAbstract: 'Like the cities they represent, interactive maps are complicated feats of engineering. They are resource-intensive microcosms of state management, requiring special data formats and styling specifications. When the needs of an application go beyond showing points on a map, cartographic applications can quickly grow unwieldy and unsustainable. Throw moving targets, messy data, and squeezed timelines into the mix, and you\'ve got an enormous component that does everything – poorly. This talk discusses the latest mapping technology and approaches to building better components - map-based or otherwise.',

In this talk, we\'ll explore a number of use cases and explore how to model them using modifiers. Some good; some ambiguous; some plain silly.',

Maybe you\'ve tried to set them up and been overwhelmed or maybe you\'ve never even heard of them. Core concepts can help developers frame their thoughts about testing and structuring tests. We\'ll explore those core concepts and look at how to leverage existing libraries like Sinon.js, Pretender.js, and even ember-cli-mirage, with examples to make your test suite more stable and reliable.',
